To determine which vertices of a procedurally generated sphere should get affected and how much by a 2D heightmap decal with its center mapped to a point on that sphere, you can follow these steps:

1. Compute the distance between each vertex of the sphere and the center point of the decal. You can use the Euclidean distance formula for this:
distance = sqrt((x_vertex - x_decal_center)^2 + (y_vertex - y_decal_center)^2 + (z_vertex - z_decal_center)^2)

2. Determine the radius of the decal. You can use the maximum value in the heightmap as the radius.

3. For each vertex that is within the radius of the decal, compute the amount of displacement by sampling the heightmap at the appropriate 2D position. 
You can use a bilinear interpolation to get a smooth transition between neighboring pixels in the heightmap.

4. Apply the displacement to the affected vertices by moving them along their normal vectors by the computed amount.
