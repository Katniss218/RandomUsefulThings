        // The proportion of light that is scattered away from its incident direction is a product of a

        // - between the incoming light ray and the scattering direction.The phase function then
        // - returns the amount of light that is scattered under the given angle θ.

        // Phase function `Ph`:

        // Scattering Coefficient `βs`:
        // - represents the percentage of light scattered away.

        // Extinction Coefficient `βe`:
        // - represents the percentage of light scattered away or absorbed (or `1 - that`?).
        // - air molecules don't absorb light, so for air `βe = βs`.



        // "Out-scattered" light:
        // - Light can be "out-scattered" away from the path of a ray. See [Scattering Coefficient].

        // "In-scattered" light:
        // - Light scattered away from a ray/path can get reflected and "in-scattered" into the path of a different ray.
